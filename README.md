# Running the app
 
This app is meant to be a starting point for WebVR. You can play around with VR primitives like a-box, a-sphere and generate simple VR scenes. Also, the corresponding html code is generated. <b>Access the app here: https://share.streamlit.io/jojo96/webvrcodegenerator/main/ar.py </b>
 
The app interface:

Some of the various supported [primitives](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/introduction/) are:
- a-box
- a-sphere
- a-ring
- a-cylinder
- a-torus-knot
- a-plane


Also, one can include point light or ambient light in the scene, change environment or add fog!!

These various options can be selected in the sidebar and the button <b>Generate Web VR</b> will render the <b>VR Scene</b> and generate <b>HTML code</b>. This HTML code can be saved in an index.html file and served using a web server.

You can use the [ZapWorks command-line tool](https://docs.zap.works/universal-ar/zapworks-cli/) to serve your HTML folder over HTTPS for access on your local computer:

      zapworks serve .

Remember to run the command within the folder that has your saved index.html file.

This is how the app looks in real time.
